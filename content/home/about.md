# Hello!

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am a senior research economist at the Central Bank of Malta's Research Department. I was previously working as an economist at the European Central Bank, and as a macroeconomic researcher at the Rokos' hedge fund in London.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>My research interests include monetary policy, time-series econometrics, and forecasting. I am also involved in understanding the effects of monetary policy surprises on financial assets. In the last years, I have extensively worked on this topic using high-frequency data.  </p>
