# Hello!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. My research interests include time series, econometrics, and forecasting. I am also interested in understanding the effects of monetary and macroeconomic surprises on real and financial variables. In the last years, I have worked a lot with long high-frequency time series of intra-minute data, to deepen these topics. 

I am working as a senior economist in the research team at the Central Bank of Malta. I was previously working as an economist at the European Central Bank and as a macroeconomic researcher in the Rokos Capital hedge fund in London.
