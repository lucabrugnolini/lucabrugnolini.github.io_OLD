We show that three factors capture about all of the variation in the yield curve but that these are different factors with different variance shares in the window that contains the rate decision announcement and the window that contains the press conference. We also show that the QE-related policy factor has been dominant in the recent period and that its effects have been very persistent on the long-end of the yield curve, with a half-life nearing two years. To carry out the analysis, we construct and describe the euro area Monetary Policy Event-Study Database. This database, which contains both daily and intraday asset price changes around the rate decision announcements as well as around press conferences, is a contribution on its own right and we expect it to be the standard in monetary policy research for the euro area.\n","tags":null,"title":"Measuring Euro Area Monetary Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brugnolini L."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535673600,"objectID":"a67d37c58689ce523678e8923837136d","permalink":"https://lucabrugnolini.github.io/publication/article_3_forecasting_inflation/","publishdate":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article_3_forecasting_inflation/","section":"publication","summary":"I develop a two-step subset selection procedure to extract the best-performing predictors from a large dataset and combine them to identify a set of best-performing models.

The rule requires the signatory states to target a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60%. Within the context of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models (DSGE), we augment a fully micro-founded New-Keynesian model with a parametric linear debt consolidation rule, and we analyse the effects on the main macroeconomic aggregates. To fully understand its implications on the economy, we study different debt consolidation scenarios, allowing the excess debt to be re-absorbed with different timings. We show that including a debt consolidation rule can exacerbate the effects of the shocks in the economy by imposing a constraint on the public debt process. Secondly, we note that the effect of loosening or tightening the rule in response to a shock is heterogeneous. Shocks hitting nominal variables (monetary policy shock) are not particularly sensitive. On the contrary, we prove that the same change has a more pronounced effect in case of shock hitting real variables (productivity and public spending shocks). Finally, we show that the macroeconomic framework worsens as a function of the rigidity of the debt consolidation rule. As a limiting case, we show that the effects on output, employment, real wages, inflation, and interest rates are sizable.

The selection procedure consists in (i) select the best iBest variables according to several out-of-sample criteria and then use these variables in models that use their combination. More specifically:\n the procedure selects the best iBest variables using two different criteria (mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) included in the model as a vector fLoss of functions in the form f(Prediction,TrueValue)). This selection step is univariate, i.e. the variables are chosen by running a simple out-of-sample regression of the target variable on each variable of the dataset.\n the iBest variables are combined into set of 2, 3, \u0026hellip;, iBest variables. For each of these sets, the model is estimated and then avaluated out-of-sample. The best model is the one with the lowest out-of-sample MSE. We also augment each model with the first principal component of all variable in the dataset. Thus, there are a total of 2 (2^iBest) models.\n  The complexity is O((T-Ts)*2^iBest) where T is the sample size, Ts is the number of observation in the initial estimation window.\nExample Forecasting US non-farm-payroll one and two months ahead H = [1,2] using a dataset containing 116 US variables taken from McCracken and Ng (2015). iBest is set to 16.
