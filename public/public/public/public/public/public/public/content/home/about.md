# Hello!

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am a senior economist working in the research team at the Central Bank of Malta. I was previously working as an economist at the European Central Bank and as a macroeconomic researcher in the Rokos Capital hedge fund in London.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am also a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. My research interests include time series, econometrics, and forecasting. I am also interested in understanding the effects of monetary and macroeconomic surprises on real and financial variables. In the last years, I have extensively worked on this topic using high-frequency time series.  </p>
